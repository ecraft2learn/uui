<a href="#" onclick="tileClick('https://www.tinkercad.com/#/?type=circuits&collection=designs','TinkerCad Circuit Design', event);">Tinkercad</a> is a free web-based app for creating 3D models suitable for 3D printing. 
You donÂ´t need previous experience with CAD (computer-aided design) to use this tool.
Besides 3D modeling, with this app you can create electronic circuits, connecting Arduinos to sensors and actuators, as well as simulate their running. 
You might need to update your browser to view the simulations correctly.
