<h2>Tinkercad</h2>
<p>
<a href="#" onclick="tileClick('https://www.tinkercad.com/#/?type=tinkercad&collection=designs','TinkerCad Circuit Design', event);">Tinkercad</a> is a free web-based app for creating 3D models suitable for 3D printing.
You don´t need previous experience with CAD (computer-aided design) to create and print impressive 3D models.
Users create models via the Tinkercad interface, in constrast to <a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#BeetleBloxDialog', event);" >BeetleBlocks</a> which supports creating programs that construct 3D models.
The main functions you can use are: 
1) Place basic building blocks that can be added or removed (users can also import their own forms or work with existing ones). 
2) Adjust, move and/or rotate shapes freely in space. 
3) Combine or group together a set of shapes to create detailed templates.

<p>
Tinkercad can also be used to <a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#TinkerCadCircuitDesignDialog', event);">construct electronic circuits connected to Arduinos and simulate their running</a> (check the next Tinkercad tool).
</p>
<p>
*The eCraft2Learn project is investigating the possibility of providing support and integration of this tool.
