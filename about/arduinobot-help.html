<p>
	The Arduinobot is a small binary service that runs on a Raspberry Pi, or other linux-based machine. To use it, your computer, tablet or phone needs to be on the same network, connected with a cable or wireless network.
</p>


<p>
	The in-line web server of Arduinobot serves a web page, containing a web-based code editor alongside buttons for invoking remote functions; compiling and uploading code from the Arduinobot computer to a connected Arduino microcontroller.
</p>
<p>
	Arduinobot picks up these user requests, forwarding them to an MQTT server over web sockets (ports 80, 443) and further configuration is picked up as a retained message on the topic config. Arduinobot then listens to the MQTT topics verify and upload in order to perform compilation and flashing jobs. Messages are in JSON format. It also listens for REST calls on a given port to perform the same kind of operations.
</p>
<p>
	It also holds a web server, written in Nim and scripts that communicate with a Arduino IDE running headlessly on the same computer, or on a remote device.
