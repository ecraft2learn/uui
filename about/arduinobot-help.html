<p>
	The Arduinobot is a  binary service that runs on a Raspberry Pi, or other linux-based machine. 
	To use it, your computer, tablet or phone need to be on the same network, connected with a cable or wireless network.
</p>
<p>
	The in-line web server of Arduinobot serves a web page, containing the web-based code editor <a href="https://codemirror.net" target="_blank">Code Mirror</a> alongside buttons for invoking 
	remote functions; compiling and uploading code from the Arduinobot computer to a connected Arduino microcontroller, via a local MQTT broker
	over web sockets (ports 80, 443) and further configuration is picked up as a retained message on the topic config. 
</p>
<p>
	The service also holds a web server, written in Nim and scripts that communicate with a Arduino IDE running headlessly on the same computer, or on a remote device.
