<h2>Scratch for RPi</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/scratch/" target="_blank">Scratch for the Raspberry Pi</a> is a free app and it is included in the standard <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> release.
It has ability to communicate with the Raspberry Pi pins that (confusingly) relies upon broadcasting primitive blocks.

It is documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/scratch2/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
