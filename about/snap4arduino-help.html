<h2>Snap4Arduino</h2>
<p>
Snap4Arduino adds several new blocks to <a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#SnapDialog', event);">Snap!</a> for the purpose of controlling <a href="http://www.arduino.org/" target="_blank">Arduinos</a>.
Its many features are documented <a href="http://snap4arduino.rocks" target="_blank">here</a>, among which is worthy to mention that it is blocks-based and dynamic; supports almost all arduino boards; allows the user to interact with multiple boards simultaneously.
</p>
<p>  
*Note that the web version runs only in Chrome and requires the installation of a Chrome extension.
To do so unzip <a href="https://ecraft2learn.github.io/uui/snap4arduino/crx.zip" download>this file</a>,
go to chrome://extensions and drag and drop the folder there.
This has already been performed if you are using an eCraft2Learn SD card on a Raspberry Pi.
</p>
<p>
*The eCraft2Learn Snap! blocks for communicating with AI cloud services and machine learning require HTTPS support.
Until the site <a href="https://github.com/bromagosa/Snap4Arduino/issues/177" target="_blank">supports HTTPS</a>
we are using a fully-functional copy of Snap4Arduino except that it cannot communicate with the Snap! cloud.
Projects should be saved to the browser's memory or exported to the local file system.

<p>
The AI blocks can be imported into Snap4Arduino to add new blocks to many of the blocks palettes including "sensing", "sounds", and "looks".
