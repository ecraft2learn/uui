    This is a tool that helps you and the instructors to evaluate your progress during a project. Your instructor will add project-specific self-evaluation modules to this tool where you can answer questions and 
    evaluate your progress. The answers will then be reviewd by an instructor which evaluates your work. You can see your progress then as star given to your group in the user manu on top right.
