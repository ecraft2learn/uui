<p>
<a href="#" onclick="tileClick('./beetleblocks/', 'beetleblocks', event);">BeetleBlocks</a> is a unique tool to make 3D models by using blocks of codes to generate different kinds of models. 
On the interface, you have a source of code blocks, the area where you can connect the blocks and a 3D window to visualize your work in progress. 
The software works by programming a beetle to move and work in different ways to create your projects. 
Generated models can be saved as STL or OBJ files suitable for 3D printing.
</p>
<p>  
BeetleBlocks adds several new blocks to <a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#SnapDialog', event);">Snap!</a> for the purpose of programmatically generating 3D models.
The alternative approach to creating models is via direct manipulation of the interface. See <a href="#" onclick="helpClick('#TinkerCad3DDesignDialog', event);">Tinkercad</a>.
This web app is a software that runs preferably in Google chrome browser.
