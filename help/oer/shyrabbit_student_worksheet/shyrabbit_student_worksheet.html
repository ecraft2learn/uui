<h1>The shy rabbit project</h1>
<p><img src="../../../help/oer/shyrabbit_student_worksheet/shyrabbit.png" width="200" height="250" /></p>
<p>1.	Have you ever noticed that some animals (rabbits for instance) hide as soon as they hear a loud sound? How do you explain that?</p> 
<p>2.	The success of human creations is often due to the fact that they simulate nature in a very persuasive way.</p> 
<p>3.	Can you create a rabbit made by paperboard and make it hide as soon as it hears a loud sound? What kind of material and devices will you need to do so?</p>
<div>Discuss in group and write down or paint your work plan here...</div>
<p><img src="../../../help/oer/shyrabbit_student_worksheet/space.png" width="800" height="400" /></p>
<p>4.	Create the rabbit with the tools and material you will find in the lab. During the creation process, take photos of the rabbit and select and save some of them in the group’s folder.</p>
<p>5.	Now, make the rabbit hide as soon as it hears a loud sound.</p>
<div>Tip 1: Link the ArduinoUno board pinA0 to the mic so that you can «read» the analog values of the volume.</div> 
<div>Tip 2: Link an angle servo to an Arduino pin. Find on the Internet information on the angle servo mechanism. Link the rabbit to the motor so that it “hides” for some time, in case it hears a loud sound, and shows up again after a while.</div> 
<div>Tip 3: Turn on Snap!4Arduino in order to program the rabbit’s behavior. It could help to make the rabbit react also to light (with the use of light resistance that you used for the lighthouse).</div>
<div>Tip 4:  Think of all the similar behavior of other animals and how you would design relevant scenarios.</div>
<p>6.	Prepare a presentation of the current state of your work to share with the other groups.</p>
<div>Don’t forget to take notes on your diary!</div>
