				RISK OF BURNS
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:659px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				There is a potential risk of burns, as the print head can reach temperatures of up to 260°C and the heated bed can

			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:746px; left:132px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				Always let the printer cool down for at least 30 minutes before performing maintenance or modifications.

				Therefore good ventilation is required, and long term exposure should be avoided. It is advisable to use a fume hood
