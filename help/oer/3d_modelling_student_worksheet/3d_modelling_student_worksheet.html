<h1>3D modelling</h1>
<p><strong>TEAM:</p> 
<p>DATE:</strong></p>
<p>1. Discuss with your team and find some items that would be useful to add to your robotic construction.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../uui/help/oer/sunflower_student_worksheet/space.png" width="800" height="200" /></p>
<p>2.Think of these objects as three-dimensional models. Really, what is a "3D Model / 3D Model"? Search online and exchange views in your team.</p>
<p>3.How can you build your own 3D model? Which technologies could help you? Discuss about it in the group and look for information online.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>...EXPERIMENTATION AT TINKERCAD...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Open the Tinkercad environment (you'll need to login with your teacher's account). Observe the environment. Can you locate the following and explain their usefulness?</p>

<p>(1) ___________________________________</p>
<p><img src="../../../../uui/help/oer/3d_modelling_student_worksheet/grid.png" width="200" height="100" /></p>
<p>(2) ___________________________________</p> 
<p><img src="../../../../uui/help/oer/3d_modelling_student_worksheet/workplane_ruler.png" width="350" height="100" /></p>
<p>(3) ___________________________________</p>
<p>5.Enter a shape on the design surface and experiment with its dimensions. For example: 
<p>(a) Can you give a cube the form of a label?</p> 
<p><img src="../../../../uui/help/oer/3d_modelling_student_worksheet/red_blocks.png" width="200" height="100" /></p>
<p>(b) Can you make a cube look like a piece of butter? Experiment freely with various shapes.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../uui/help/oer/3d_modelling_student_worksheet/yellow_blocks.png" width="200" height="100" /></p>
<p>6.	A three-dimensional shape in Tinkercad can be solid but can also be hole. What is the difference between solids and holes? Can you make the following using solids and holes (or some other model of yours, for example an emoticon, or the packman's avatars ...)?</p>
<p><img id=img1 src="../../../../uui/help/oer/3d_modelling_student_worksheet/complex_red_block.png" width="200" height="100" /></p>
<div>Tip1: Select your solids and holes with your mouse. After that, make a Group so as to remove the "shape-holes" from the "solids-shapes".<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.Can you put a roof on a cube to form a house? What solids do you need? How do you make them touch each other?</p>
<p><img id= img1 src="../../../../uui/help/oer/3d_modelling_student_worksheet/house_construction.png" width="300" height="150" /></p>
<div>Tip 2: Insert a new workplane on the top of the base of the house. The new three-dimensional shape you enter will be placed on the new workplane and will be fully tied to the base of the house.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.Enter TEXT on the design surface. What can we do with it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>...I ENRICH AND DECORATE MY ROBOTIC ARTEFACT...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.Now that you've explored Tinkercad's basic functions, think again about the model you want to design for your robotic construction. Get paper, pencil and ruler!</p>
<div>Graphic display + dimensions:</div>
<p><img src="../../../../uui/help/oer/sunflower_student_worksheet/space.png" width="800" height="200" /></p>
<div>Tip 3: Try to imagine it from various angles. The dimensions of the object that you will make will affect its printing time. Discuss with your teacher about the printing time of the models.</div>
<p>10.Let's move on to the three-dimensional design in Tinkercad! Which shapes will you need? Which tools? Will you need to insert workplanes? Work collectively. Make pictures during the process.</p>
<p>11.Name your file (e.g. sign_team1). Export your model as stl. Save also locally in your folder.</p>
<p>12.Prepare your file for the 3D printer in Cura. Check the duration of the printout, the weight of the object, its dimensions and the printing material.</p>
<p>13.Transfer the gcode file to the printer.</p>
<p>14.While your model is being printed ... try to optimize robotic construction (solar bank, etc ...)</p>
<p>15.Get prepared to talk about your current work with to the rest of the teams.</p>
