<h3>It detects the distance of the closest object in front of the sensor (it use sound instead of light&nbsp;as in the IR sensor).&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>It measures&nbsp;distance by sending out a sound wave at a specific frequency and listening for that sound&nbsp;wave to bounce back. By recording the elapsed time between the sound wave being&nbsp;generated and the sound wave bouncing back, it is possible to calculate the distance&nbsp;between the sonar sensor and the object.</h3>
