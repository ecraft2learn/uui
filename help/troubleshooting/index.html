<h3>Trouble shooting advice</h3>
<p>
The eCraft2Larn Unified User Interface (the UUI) works best in Chrome.
If you encounter problems with other browsers please report it and switch to Chrome (or Chromium on Raspberry Pis).
</p>
<p>
If you are reading this on a Raspberry Pi that was configured by eCraft2Larn project members
then report any problems to them since all the following should have been done.

<h4 id="snap4arduino">Snap4Ardunio troubleshooting</h4>
<p>
If Snap4Ardunio launches but cannot connect to the Arduino this is because the web version runs only in Chrome
and requires the installation of a Chrome extension.
To do so unzip <a href="/uui/snap4arduino/crx.zip" download>this file</a>,
go to chrome://extensions and drag and drop the folder there.
Be sure that the browser is in "Developer Mode".
You'll find a switch for enabling it on the upper right corner of the chrome://extensions tab.
</p>

<figcaption>The Snap4Ardunio extension will only work if you enable "Developer Mode" in Chrome</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Setting up the Snap4Ardunio extension has already been performed if you are using an eCraft2Learn SD card on a Raspberry Pi.
</p>
<p>
*Snap4Arduino communicates with the Arduino using something called <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/firmata" target="_blank">Firmata</a>
which needs to installed on the Arduino.
<a href="../../about/firmata-installation-instructions.pdf" target="_blank">Here are Firmata installation instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the extension is installed and Snap4Ardunio still cannot connect to the Arduino on a USB port then sometimes
disconnecting and then reconnecting the USB cable resets the connection.
Remember it is always a good idea when finished running Snap4Ardunio to disconnect from the Arduino.
</p>

<figcaption>To avoid problems next time you connect, disconnect before leaving Snap4Ardunio</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The version of Snap4Ardunio launched by the UUI currently cannot connect to the Snap! cloud.
Projects can be saved to the browser's local storage or exported to the local file system.
The version of Snap4Ardunio that runs at snap4arduino.rocks does not support HTTPS which is required for the educational extensions.
The Snap4Ardunio team is aware of the problem and has plans to fix it.
Once they do the UUI will be changed to launch that version.
</p>
<h4 id="tinkercad-cura-on-raspberry-pi">Tinkercad and Cura trouble shooting</h4>
<p>
The only known problems with Tinkercad and Cura are that they are not usuable on Raspberry Pis.
Tinkercad can be too slow to be useful or it may show a black rectangle in the construction area.
Cura can't be run on the Raspberry Pi.
If your environment has been configured with servers running these programs on VNC then launch the VNC program.
Otherwise run them on a PC or Mac.
</p>
<h4 id="tinkercad-registration">Tinkercad requires a user register</h4>
<p>
If one registers and logs into Tinkercad then the UUI can be used to launch it for 3D modelling or for circuit design.
<b>We strongly recommend that users log into Tinkercad before launching it from the UUI.</b>b>
The browser can remember the login so the same user on the same computer need only do this once.
</p>

<h4 id="styling-issues">Styling Issues</h4>
<p>
Sometimes you might notice that the styling for the page is not loaded correctly. You can see an example such situation below: <br/><br/>
<img src="./img/bad_styling.png">
<br/><br/>
In order to fix this issues we recommend the following:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Refresh the page. You can do this by pressing <b>F5</b> on the keyboard or pressing the <b>Refresh Button</b> on the browser.</li>
  <li>Do a refresh-all on the page. You can do this by holding the <b>Ctrl</b> or both <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> (Ctrl+Shift) buttons while refreshing the page.</li>
  <li>Clear browsing data for the website. Do the following steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Open Google Chrome's (or Chromium) mesnu by clicking on the <b>Menu</b> on the top right corner. (The butyon looks like 3 dots arranged vertically)</li>
      <li>Goto <b>Settings</b></li>
      <li>Scroll to the bottom and click on <b>Show advanced settings</b>.</li>
      <li>Under <b>Privacy</b> section, click on <b>Content Settings</b>.</li>
      <li>Under <b>Cookies</b>, click on <b>All cookies and site data</b>. It opens a new window with a list showing all stored cookies and cache.</li>
      <li>Type the name of the website (in this case ecraft2learn) in the <b>Search cookies</b> text box in the top right corner. The list is filtered showing only data from the searched domain.</li>
      <li>Now delete individual site data by clicking on the cross at the right side, or clear everything in the filtered list by clicking on the Remove all button.</li>
