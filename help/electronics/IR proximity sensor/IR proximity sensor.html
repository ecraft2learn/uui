<h3 style="text-align: justify;">IR is a light with wavelength that is not visible to human eyes, but cameras&nbsp;can see it.&nbsp;It is used in many applications, such as TV remote and Night-&nbsp;vision cameras.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">In a Proximity Sensor, an IR LED and a Photodiode are used to detect&nbsp;obstacles. The IR LED transmits light in forward direction. When an&nbsp;obstacle is ahead, the light reflects and the Photodiode is activated. By&nbsp;this method, an obstacle is detected. Finally, the sensor measure the distance of&nbsp;the object and return a value (e.g. cm).</h3>
