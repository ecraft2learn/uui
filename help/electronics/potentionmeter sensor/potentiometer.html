<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A manually adjustable, variable resistor with three terminals. Two terminals are&nbsp;connected to a resistive element, the third terminal is connected to an adjustable&nbsp;wiper. The position of the wiper determines the output voltage.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">In sum, a sliding or rotating contact that create a resistance change that we can read&nbsp;into the Arduino board as an analog value.&nbsp;For instance, you can connect three wires&nbsp;to the Arduino board. The first goes to ground from one of the outer pins of the&nbsp;potentiometer. The second goes from 5 volts to the other outer pin of the&nbsp;potentiometer. The third goes from analog input 2 to the middle pin of the&nbsp;potentiometer.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">By turning the shaft of the potentiometer, we change the amount of resistence on&nbsp;either side of the wiper which is connected to the center pin of the potentiometer.&nbsp;This changes the relative "closeness" of that pin to 5 volts and ground, giving us a&nbsp;different analog input. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there are&nbsp;0 volts going to the pin, and we read 0. When the shaft is turned all the way in the&nbsp;other direction, there are 5 volts going to the pin and we read 1023.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">In between,&nbsp;analogRead() returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the&nbsp;amount of voltage being applied to the pin.</h3>
